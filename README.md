# OpenCV---Project
I learned about OpenCV from my College friends, and they conducted several sessions on the basic functions used in OpenCV. After completing all the basics, I was tasked to create a project using the thing I learned about OpenCV. Here I have created a small game that is to match the slice.
<br>
In this game there are 3 modes
<br>
1.Easy mode: Here a random slice of a image is given to us and we have to perform horizontal/vertical slice to the image so that it matches the random slice given to us.
<br>
2.Medium mode: Here a random slice of a image is given but it is also flipped.Now we have to perform horizontal/vertical slice to the image and flip it horizontally/vertically so that it matches the random slice given to us.
<br>
3.Hard mode:Here instead of a single random slice, two random slice is given to use but not only that it is also flipped and concantenated horizontally. We have to follow the same steps as of last 2 modes but here we have to perform the slice and flip operation 2 times separately (because two random slices are given) and concatenate the images horizontally.

I loved working on this mini project and it was fun. I thank all my friends who taught me OpenCV and encourage everyone to learn more about OpenCV.
